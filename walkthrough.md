```ts
import { Schema as S } from '@effect/schema'
```

## Creating a `Struct` schema

This is a schema with two properties: `name` is a string, and `age` is a number that comes in as a string.

```ts
const Person = S.Struct({
  name: S.String,
  age: S.NumberFromString,
})
```

Note that `Person` kind of _looks_ like a TypeScript type, but it's not - it's a JavaScript object. We can obtain the corresponding type though:

```ts
type Person = typeof Person.Type

const p1: Person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 42, // ok
}

const p2: Person = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: '35',
  //‚ùå ~~~ Type 'string' is not assignable to 'number'
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> It might seem strange to give the type the same name as the schema object, but it's OK ‚Äî and it's idiomatic in Effect.

Similarly, we can obtain the type of the _encoded_ form:

```ts
type PersonEncoded = typeof Person.Encoded

const p3: PersonEncoded = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: '42', // ok
}√±

const p4: PersonEncoded = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 35,
  //‚ùå~~~ Type 'number' is not assignable to 'string'
}
```

## Creating a `Class` schema

Alternatively, we can avoid the weirdness of having to define `Person` as both the `Struct` and its corresponding type, by using a `Schema.Class` instead:

```ts
class Person extends S.Class<Person>('Person')({
  name: S.String,
  age: S.NumberFromString,
}) {}
```

## Using a schema to encode and decode data

The schema itself doesn't _do_ anything: It's just a definition ‚Äî just data. But other tools provided by @effect/schema can _use_ the schema definition to do things like **validate** and **transform** data.

One of the things we can use a schema for is to convert between some incoming form, to the form we want to work with.

In this example, we said `age` is a number that "comes in" as a string.

- Maybe it's persisted that way.
- Maybe we get it that way from an HTML input.
- Maybe that's what we get back from an API call.

In this case the _encoded_ form is a string, and the _decoded_ form is a number.

```ts
const decode = S.decodeSync(Person)
const encoded = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: '25', // <- string
}

const decoded = decode(encoded)
// {
//   name: 'Alice',
//   age: 25 // <- number üëç
// }
```

The `decodeSync` function creates a decoder that expects the encoded type ‚Äî in this case `EncodedPerson`.

To make a decoder that can be used to validate something of unknown shape, you can use `decodeUnknownSync`:

```ts
const decode = S.decodeUnknownSync(Person)
const decoded = decode({ foo: 'bar' }) // ‚ùå throws
```

You can then catch that error and respond appropriately.

If the incoming data has **excess properties**, they're left out of the result.

```ts
const decoded = encode({
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 42,
  // @ts-expect-error
  foo: 'bar', // <- excess
})
// the `foo` property is omitted from the result
// {
//   name: 'Alice',
//   age: 25
// }
```

## Using a schema to validate data

There are functions to validate in @effect/schema. These are used to confirm that a given value is _already_ in the target schema,
not that it can be decoded.

```ts
const schema = S.Date
const validate = S.validateSync(schema)

// I use this to confirm that a value is already the target type
const d = new Date('2024-06-11')
expect(validate(d)).toBe(d)

// If it's not, an error is thrown
expect(() => validate({ 'this is not': 'a date' })).toThrow()
```

This doesn't work the way I thought, which that you'd use it to tell whether something could be decoded:

```ts
expect(validate('1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z')).toEqual(true)
```

I think the way to actually validate is just to try to decode:

```ts
const decode = S.decodeUnknownSync(schema)
expect(decode('2024-06-11')).toBeInstanceOf(Date)
expect(() => decode('asdf')).toThrow()
```

## Default values

A schema can define defaults for optional values.

```ts
class Person extends S.Class<Person>('Person')({
  name: S.String,
  age: S.NumberFromString,
  createDate: S.optional(S.DateFromNumber),
}) {}

const decode = S.decodeUnknownSync(Person)
const alice = decode({ name: 'alice', age: '42' })
// {
//   name: 'alice',
//   age: 42,
//   createDate: [Date]
// }
```
